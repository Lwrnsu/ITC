				<h1>DE LUNA, JAY LAWRENCE S.</h1>
				<p>Born on April 25, 2007 at Bataan General Hospital, Balanga City, Bataan. At my toddler stage, I was raised at Bataan. In Bataan, my grandmother takes care of me. There, I only play outside with my cousins. Few months before starting my education, I moved here at Olongapo City, Zambales, I was taken care by my other grandmother. In my primary education, I studied and graduated at Sta. Rita Elementary School. My only interest is playing, that is why I am one of the students below the class list. In my secondary education, I studied and graduated at St. Joseph College Olongapo City. In those days, my life started to revolve.  </p>
				<br>
				<p>My interest was still playing video games, but it started to lessen. In my 10th grade, I got interested at academics. Because of that, I gained recognition. Then all of a sudden, I got interested in programming. Because of my habit of playing video games, I quickly adapted to technology. Firstly, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then, I went to Gordon College to pursue Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. There, I've got deep understanding and knowledge about programming. While studying, I also learned various languages and skills all by my self. I've been learning by my self because I want to deepen my skills. I've learned and mastered all the backend technologies such as Java, C#, and JavaScript. Also, I've mastered the frontend technologies that I've learned in the start. After learning, I've created many projects to master all of them. Therefore, I became a Full-stack developer. Because of this skills, I applied for a job on my third year. I got accepted, I will gain experience for me to progress quickly after graduation. While having a work, I've still learning. I know that the technology is constantly evolving, therefore I had to keep up. On my free time, I've learned Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. With this, I have a solid background on programming. Fast forward, I've graduated Cum Laude on Gordon College with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</p>
				<br>
				<p>After graduation, I've applied for another job outside the country. With my 2 years experience and solid background in programming, I got accepted. Several years, I am promoted to a Senior Software Engineer and a Principal AI Engineer, I am so happy. The hardwork paid off! Everything is attainable when you work hard for it. This is my journey on my careerâ€”Software Engineer.</p>
